## üìò Overview
This project is the first warm-up assignment for the Data Science and AI course.  
It focuses on building an image classification model for the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset,  
which contains 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items from 10 different categories.

The aim was to understand practical aspects of:
- Setting up the PyTorch environment  
- Data loading, preprocessing, and splitting  
- Implementing and comparing classical ML and deep learning models  
- Tracking performance metrics and visualizing diagnostics

## üß© Models Implemented
1. **Logistic Regression (Baseline)**  
   - Flattened pixel input  
   - Achieved ~79% accuracy  
   - Good for simple, linearly separable classes  

2. **Neural Network (PyTorch)**  
   - 3 fully connected layers with ReLU activations and Dropout  
   - Achieved ~88% accuracy on test data  
   - Better generalization and feature learning

## üìä Results Summary
| Model | Accuracy | Notes |
|:------|:----------|:------|
| Logistic Regression | ~79% | Struggled with similar-looking classes (shirts, coats) |
| Neural Network | ~88% | Improved feature extraction and reduced confusion |

Key observations:
- Linear models are limited for complex texture differences.  
- Neural networks learn richer representations even with basic architectures.  
- Misclassifications mainly occur among visually similar classes.
